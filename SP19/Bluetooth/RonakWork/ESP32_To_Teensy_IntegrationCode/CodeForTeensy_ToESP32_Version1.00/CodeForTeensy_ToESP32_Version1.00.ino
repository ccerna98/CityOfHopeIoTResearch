/*
   There are three serial ports on the ESP known as U0UXD, U1UXD and U2UXD.

   U0UXD is used to communicate with the ESP32 for programming and during reset/boot.
   U1UXD is unused and can be used for your projects. Some boards use this port for SPI Flash access though
   U2UXD is unused and can be used for your projects.
